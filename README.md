# DiscHernia_DeepLearning
Deep learning Python model on 3-class disc hernia classification (L4/L5; L5/S1; healthy)

The file represents the final step in 3-class disc hernia classification (L4/L5; L5/S1; healthy) on sagital view MR images of spine with discus hernia. 
Full methodology includes several steps starting from segmentation of region of interest (ROI), 
in this case disc area, bounding box cropping and enhancement of ROI, 
after which the image is classified based on convolutional neural network (CNNs) into adequate classes 
(healthy, bulge, central, right or left herniation for axial view and healthy, L4/L5, L5/S1 level of herniation on sagittal view).
